[中文](README.md) | **English**

Turn Claude Code from "an amnesiac coding tool that forgets every session" into "a cross-session, multi-channel personal secretary with a real persona and rituals."

This is **not yet another LLM wiki**. It's a complete secretary operating system — the knowledge base is just one of its organs.

> **clawd** = **Claude** + **wd** (working directory). A secretary agent living in `~/.clawd/` that manages two domains of your knowledge (work and life), covering the full loop: capture → digest → retrieve → reflect.

## How it differs from similar products

| | intern-clawd | OpenClaw | Vanilla Claude Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Personal secretary on top of Claude Code | Self-hosted AI agent (multi-IM access) | General coding assistant |
| Cost | $0 (runs on your Claude Code subscription) | API pay-per-use (Opus 4.6: $15/$75 per MTok) | $20/mo Max or $100/mo Pro |
| Runtime | Pure files, zero services | Node.js long-running service | Built-in |
| Knowledge persistence | ✅ Dual-domain wiki (work / life), three-layer architecture | ⚠️ Skill files + conversation memory | ⚠️ Flat auto-memory notes |
| Persona + rituals | ✅ Secretary persona + standup / weekly / reflect… | ⚠️ Skill system (user-defined) | ❌ Manual prompting each time |
| Multi-channel capture | ✅ Terminal + hotkey + IM (optional) | ✅ Terminal + IM | ✅ Terminal + IM (DIY) |
| Session routing | ✅ Auto-archives JSONLs by project | ❌ | ❌ Piles up by cwd |
| Self-maintenance | ✅ Lint + monthly maintenance + tiered index | ❌ | ❌ |
| Dependencies | Python 3 + Claude Code | Node 22+, runs standalone | None |
| Install | `clone + setup.sh` (3 min) | One-liner script (needs Node) | Built-in |
| Uninstall | ✅ `uninstall.sh` + rollback script | ✅ | — |

**How to choose**: Want to chat with AI on your phone → OpenClaw. Want Claude Code itself to be smarter, with memory and rhythm → intern-clawd. They can coexist: use OpenClaw as the IM channel, use intern-clawd to manage knowledge.

## What problem does it solve

Vanilla Claude Code is just "a coding assistant that works one session at a time." When you try to do more with it, you hit a few walls:

| Pain | How clawd fixes it |
|---|---|
| Every new session = amnesia | Persistent wiki + auto-injects index on every SessionStart |
| You have to sit at a terminal to talk to it | `⌃⌥C` global hotkey, terminal aliases, mobile IM channel (optional) |
| No "role" concept, you re-prompt every time | Persona baked into CLAUDE.md + 7 fixed rituals (standup / weekly / reflect / archive / resume / inbox / lint) |
| Work and personal notes get mixed up | Dual-domain architecture: `work/` + `life/`, independent index and log |
| Sessions started from `~` all pile into one folder | Session routing hooks auto-relocate JSONLs by project |
| Knowledge bases rot | wiki-lint + monthly auto-maintenance + post-write self-check |

  raw/   ← immutable source of truth (agent: read-only)
  wiki/  ← LLM-maintained layer (agent: read + write)
  schema ← constraint layer (human + agent jointly maintain)
```

The three-layer knowledge architecture is taken directly from **Andrej Karpathy**'s [LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) pattern: strict separation of "source of truth" from "LLM synthesis layer," letting the agent only Read raw and never Write, so hallucinations can't poison the source. See Karpathy's gist for the original idea.

intern-clawd extends this: on top of the wiki layer it stacks **persona + rituals + multi-channel capture**, turning "knowledge base" into "secretary."

## Quick Start (3 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amb2rZhou/intern-clawd.git ~/.clawd
cd ~/.clawd && bash setup.sh && source ~/.zshrc && clawd
```

Two commands. `setup.sh` handles all configuration automatically (hooks, settings.json, aliases, cron), then `clawd` enters secretary mode.

On first launch, the secretary detects that you haven't filled in your profile yet and **guides you through onboarding automatically** — it asks a few questions (name, role, preferences, projects, red lines) and writes the config file for you. All done via conversation, no manual file editing needed.

Once set up, type **`standup`** to see it in action. **Don't like it?** Run `bash ~/.clawd/uninstall.sh` for a one-shot cleanup.

---

## Install

### 0. Prerequisites

- macOS 14+ / Linux (verified on macOS Sequoia 15.6)
- Python 3.9+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) installed and `claude` on `PATH`
- git

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amb2rZhou/intern-clawd.git ~/.clawd
cd ~/.clawd
```

### 2. Run setup.sh

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Automatically (9 steps):
- Check dependencies (python3 / git / claude CLI)
- Create `work/life` wiki directory skeleton
- Inject wiki sync rule into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (with backup)
- Set up daily 9:07 AM cron for wiki reorganization
- Copy hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/`
- Inject hook config into `~/.claude/settings.json` (smart merge, won't overwrite existing config)
- Add `clawd` / `inbox` aliases to `~/.zshrc`

### 3. Start using

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # load the aliases just added
clawd             # enter secretary mode
```

On first launch the secretary will guide you through onboarding via conversation, filling in your profile automatically. You can also skip the guided setup and manually edit `shared-wiki/boss-profile.md`.

### Optional: Global hotkey ⌃⌥C (macOS, manual GUI)

Want one-key capture from any app? Set up a shortcut in Shortcuts.app:

1. Open Shortcuts.app, create a new shortcut
2. Add a "Run Shell Script" action with content: `/Users/$USER/.clawd/collect.sh` (absolute path)
3. Add a "Show Notification" action (osascript notifications fail silently on Sequoia, you must use this)
4. System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Services → Shortcuts → find this entry → double-click the right side and bind `⌃⌥C`

This is purely optional — core functionality works without it. See [`setup-new-machine.md`](setup-new-machine.md) §4 for details.

## Usage (the 10 you'll actually use)

| # | Trigger | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`⌃⌥C`** | You see something you want to save |
| 2 | **`clawd`** | You want to talk to the secretary |
| 3 | **`standup`** | You want to know what you've been doing recently |
| 4 | **`weekly`** | You want a full review |
| 5 | **`process inbox`** | You want the secretary to digest the inbox |
| 6 | **`reflect X`** | Project retrospective |
| 7 | **`archive X`** | Project ended |
| 8 | **`resume X`** | Project restarted |
| 9 | **`import history`** | Import historical CC sessions into wiki, auto-classify |
| 10 | **`graph`** | Generate wiki relationship graph (opens in browser) |

The Chinese keywords (站会/周会/复盘/处理 inbox/归档/继续/检查/导入历史/关系图) work too. See [`cheatsheet.md`](cheatsheet.md) for the full command list.

## Risks & Uninstall

Installing this touches several global files on your machine (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `crontab`, `~/.zshrc`). **Read [`RISKS.md`](RISKS.md) before installing** — it lists every known risk, scope of impact, mitigation, and the things the author explicitly says are "not fixed."

**Promise**: Installing intern-clawd **does not affect your ability to run vanilla Claude Code outside `~/.clawd/`**.
- The global CLAUDE.md rule is conditional on `~/.clawd` existing — zero interference with unrelated projects
- The SessionStart hook returns in ~5ms via pure bash before spawning python3 in non-secretary cwds
- cwd is the natural mode switch: enter `~/.clawd` for secretary mode, leave for fully vanilla CC

**One-shot uninstall**:

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```

What it does: backs up every file it touches → removes the wiki sync section from CLAUDE.md → strips clawd hooks from settings.json → cleans crontab → cleans zsh aliases → asks (default no) before touching `~/.clawd` data, requires typing `delete my notes` for confirmation → generates a `restore.sh` so you can roll back the uninstall itself.

See [`RISKS.md`](RISKS.md) "How to undo" section for details.

## Design principles

- **Cognitive offload over token frugality** — making you think less matters more than making the LLM cost less
- **Multiple capture entries** — when you see something worth saving, you should be able to save it in 3 seconds
- **Role > tool** — the secretary has a persona, rituals, preferences. It is not a generic chatbot
- **Immutable persistence layer** — `raw/` is read-only for the agent, so hallucinations can't poison the source
- **Self-check over manual maintenance** — wiki-lint + post-write self-check + monthly maintenance, the system takes care of itself

---

## Mobile IM channel (optional)

The core entry point is the terminal, but you can connect the secretary to any IM bot. The pattern is simple:

```
Phone message → IM Bot → call ~/.clawd/claude-wrapper.sh -p "message" → return reply → IM Bot → phone gets reply
```

**Connecting any IM takes two steps:**

1. Create a bot on your platform (Telegram BotFather / Discord Bot / Slack App / Feishu / …)
2. Have the bot call this on each incoming message:
   ```bash
   ~/.clawd/claude-wrapper.sh -p "the user's message"
   ```
   Send stdout back as the reply.

The wrapper handles command routing (standup, weekly, etc.) and context injection automatically — same experience as the terminal.

This repo includes a Feishu (Lark) reference implementation (`feishu_utils.py` / `feishu-send.sh`) that you can use as a template for other platforms.

## Acknowledgements & inspiration

- **[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)** — [the LLM Wiki three-layer pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) (raw / wiki / schema). The knowledge layer of intern-clawd is built entirely on this idea.
- **[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code)** — the entire hook system, the CLAUDE.md injection mechanism, and the SessionStart/SessionEnd lifecycle this project relies on.
- Similar-project research: `llm-wiki-agent` and `obsidian-mind` turned Karpathy's idea into pure wiki tools. intern-clawd's difference is stacking **persona + rituals + multi-channel capture** on top of the wiki layer, making it a secretary instead of a filing cabinet.
